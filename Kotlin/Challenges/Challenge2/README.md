## Challenge 2 - Description 
Ricardo and Vicente are passionate about stickers.<br>
Both also have a habit of exchanging the repeated stickers with their friends and one day they came up with an idea. <br>
They called all the friends and proposed the following: with the stickers in hand, each one tried to make an exchange with the friend who was closest, following the following rule: each one counted how many stickers he had.<br>
Then they had to divide each other's cards into equal-sized piles, as large as possible for both. Then each would choose one of the friend's piles of cards to receive. For example, if Ricardo and Vicente were to exchange cards and had respectively 8 and 12 figures, both would divide all their figures into piles of 4 figures (Ricardo would have 2 piles and Vicente would have 3 piles) and both would choose a friend's pile to receive .<br>

\-> **INPUT**<br>
The first line of the input contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 3000), indicating the number of test cases.<br>
Each test case contains 2 integers F1 (1 ≤ F1 ≤ 1000) and F2 (1 ≤ F2 ≤ 1000) indicating, respectively, the number of stickers that Ricardo and Vicente have to exchange.<br>
<br>

\-> **OUTPUT**<br>
For each input test case there will be a value at the output, representing the maximum size of the stack of stickers that could be exchanged between two players.<br>
